# Ping-Server-Render

We all have that problem in free hosting on render where the server shuts down due to inactivity
so i came up with a solution to fix the problem 💡

* This is a dummy Server 🚮
* Let us consider dummy Server as **Server 🅱️** and main Server as **Server 🅰️**
* Now this **Server 🅱️** is set to ping **Server 🅰️** after every 5 minutes
* When **Server 🅰️** is pinged then it pings back **Server 🅱️**
* That way there is always activity between the two servers and it nevers shutsdown due to inactivity 💯

_**And just like that we have a free render server that runs 24x7**_ 🤯
